Description: This package implements approaches to combining modeling forecast sets in the 
    scenario when only an estimate of the quantile function of the original forecast set
    is available. There are two basic approaches implemented: (1) a simple vincentization approach
    whereby the quantile functions are combined simply by taking the mean (or median) across
    the sets at each quantile level; (2) a simulated linear pooling approach whereby the
    a discrete set of quantile function values are used to estimate the full quantile function
    (using a generalized additive model with penalized cubic splines), and a distribution of
    'original' forecasts are back-simulated. These distributions are then combined linearl across the 
    forecasts sets, creating a multi-modal distribution, and a new quantile function is estimated
    from this combined distribution. The package also allows for pre-smoothing of the invidual 
    quantile functions before combining.
