Description: This package provides utility functions to allow for the prepartion of data sources related
    to COVID-19 hospitalization ensemble estimations.  The utilities are designed to be used only with
    data that are collected and processed by the COVID-19 Hub 
    (https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub). The functions fall into four main 
    categories: (1) processing [help load, prepare, process hospitalization quantile functions],
    (2) plotting, (3) empirical data pull functions, and (4) coverage estimation.  Note that to 
    actually estimate the ensemble, use functions in group 1 to prepare data inputs that can
    be then "ensembled" using the psSLP package
