Description: This package provides utility functions to allow for the estimation of COVID-19 hospitalization 
    ensembles. The utilities are designed to be used only with data that are collected and processed by the
    COVID-19 Hub (https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub). The functions fall into three main 
    categories: (1) processing [help load, prepare, process hospitalization quantile functions],
    (2) plotting, (3) empirical data pull functions, and (4) coverage.
